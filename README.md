**Project Chimera is an advanced AI agent designed to overcome the critical limitations of standard Large Language Models (LLMs) in strategic business environments. By integrating a hybrid Neuro-Symbolic-Causal architecture, this agent makes decisions that are not only intelligent but also safe, explainable, and provably profitable.**

---

## ‚ùó The Problem: Why Raw LLMs are Dangerous for Business

Modern LLMs are powerful, but when entrusted with critical business decisions, they can be dangerously naive and unpredictable. Without proper guardrails, they can make catastrophic mistakes. Our benchmark experiment proves this: we tasked a pure `LLM-Only` agent with managing a simulated e-commerce business for one year. Lacking an understanding of rules or the causal consequences of its actions, it drove the company into a **multi-billion dollar loss**.

---

## üí° The Solution: The Chimera Agent in Action

Project Chimera solves this by providing the LLM with a **Symbolic** safety net and a **Causal** oracle. It doesn't just guess; it brainstorms multiple strategies, checks them against business rules, and predicts their financial outcomes to find the optimal path.

You can try a **live demo** of the Strategy Lab here:

## üß© The Chimera Architecture

![The Chimera Architecture](assets/architecture.png)

* **üß† Neuro (The Brain):** The creative core (GPT-4o) that understands goals and brainstorms diverse strategies.  
* **üõ°Ô∏è Symbolic (The Guardian):** A rule engine that acts as a safety net, preventing catastrophic, rule-breaking decisions.  
* **üîÆ Causal (The Oracle):** A data-driven causal inference engine (`EconML`) that predicts the profit impact of potential decisions.

---

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Hypothesis Reasoning:** The agent actively brainstorms and evaluates multiple strategies before making a data-driven recommendation.
* **Dynamic Learning from Experience:** The agent's Causal Engine retrains periodically on its own performance data, allowing it to adapt and improve.
* **Advanced Economic Simulator:** A sophisticated simulation environment featuring non-linear dynamics like price elasticity and diminishing returns.
* **Interactive Strategy Lab:** A full-featured Streamlit application (`app.py`) for real-time interaction and analysis.
* **Automated Benchmarking Suite:** A powerful research script (`benchmark.py`) to rigorously compare different agent architectures.

## üìà Evolution & Development Report

### Starting Point: High Potential but Raw (V7.2)
Initially, our Full Neuro-Symbolic-Causal agent behaved like a lucky but shortsighted LLM+Symbolic agent due to a broken learning mechanism ‚Äî chasing short-term gains and eroding brand trust.

### Step-by-Step Improvements

#### 1. Intelligence & Strategy
- **Trust-Adjusted Profit Metric:** Added `TRUST_VALUE_MULTIPLIER` to balance profit with long-term brand trust.  
- **Dynamic Strategic Personality:** ‚ÄúStrategy Interpreter‚Äù adjusts multiplier based on mission type (profit, balanced, trust).  
- **Mandatory Rule Validation:** All hypotheses checked via `check_business_rules` before execution.  
- **Improved Forecast Accuracy:** Added `initial_ad_spend` context to CausalEngine.

#### 2. Architecture & Efficiency
- **Benchmark Speed-Up:** CausalEngine initializes once per simulation.  
- **Richer Simulation Physics:** Tuned `price_elasticity` and added `seasonality_amp`.  
- **Decision Caching:** Interactive app remembers past similar decisions.

#### 3. Benchmarking & Analysis
- **Multi-Scenario Testing:** Runs ‚ÄúBrand-Focused‚Äù, ‚ÄúProfit-Maximization‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBalanced‚Äù with separate reports.  
- **Expanded Metrics:** Added cumulative/average weekly profit and ad spend tracking.  
- **Live Strategy Feed:** Real-time logging of weekly decisions.

### üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

Project Chimera is a living project. The next steps in our vision include:

* **Deep XAI (Explainable AI):** Integrating a Causal Graph visualization layer to explain *why* the Causal Engine predicted a certain outcome.
* **Multi-Agent Competitive Simulations:** Evolving the benchmark into an ecosystem where multiple Chimera agents compete against each other in the same market.
* **Domain-Agnostic Framework:** Refactoring the core logic into a general-purpose framework for other domains like finance or healthcare.
